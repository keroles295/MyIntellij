constructors in Java:
  A constructor is a special block of code that helps us to initial value to the fields of a class. initialization of
  object or instance.
Why we should use a Constructor?
  1) when we use the constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleanable.
  2) if the fields of the class is private so it is not possible to access them outside of the class without
  constructor or a method which means we can not initialize them without a method or constructor
  3) we can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variable with the help of a constructor.
  4) if we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of a class is created
  we can put that code inside the constructor.
How to use the constructor?
  1)we create constructors inside the class when the objects of that class is created the constructor is excuted
  automaticaily.
  class Car{
  String make;
  String model;
  Car(String carMake, String carModel){
  make=carMake;
  model=carModel;}
  public static void main(String[] args){
  Car bmw=new Car("BMW", "M4");


  }
  }
Rules:
  1)constructors do not have return types not even void.
  2)The of the constructor should always be same as the name of the class.
  3)constructor can not created by static keyword.(maybe because we will
  initialize different object every time with constructor).
  4)We can use any access modifiers with constructors.
  5) if we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructor with Zero parameters
  is created by compiler(Takes the code written by us and covers that code to byte code which is easier
  for Java to understand).
  6)it is not allowed to have two constructors in a class with same number of parameters and same type.
This Keyword:
  We can use the (this ) keyword to access the instance variable when we have same name variables in your
  method or constructor or way of any block of code
this():
  calls the constructors of a class inside other constructor.
  why we should use because it helps us reuse always
