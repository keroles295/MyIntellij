Types of variables in Java:
  We have 3 Types of variables 1)local. 2)instance. 3)static.
   1)Local: are the variable that we declared inside a block of code
   They occupy the memory for shortest period of time
   downSide: They can not be access outside that a block in which they are declared
   2)Instance Variables:
   Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code.
   upSide: can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for
   each instance of that class
   3)Static varaible:
   All the variable which are defined outside a block of code with satic keyword they are
   called static variable.
   Upside:
   *they only reverse a single memory location for all the instance of aclass.
   *they can be accessed by just writting the name of the class and variable name.
  DownSide: the occupy the memory for longest period of time they always store only one value
  for all the objects of that class
 Ral life use:
   Most of the time you will be storing constant value in static variables.
   static is also used heavly with methods that donot involves instance variable
  Access Modifiers:
    There are 3 access modiffiers keyword(Private, protected, public) and 4 acess value leves
    (private, default, protected, public)
