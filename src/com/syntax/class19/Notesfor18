Constructors:
  is a block of code that use to construct object.
 Why we should them:
  constructor help use initialize objects in cleaner and more readable way.
  Advantage:
  they are better than the methods because they called automatically when we create an object.
  Most os the time fields are private because this reason we can not access them outside the class in which
  they are declared and can not initialize them.
 How I can use the constructor :
  we create the constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name.
  When we create the object of the that class is called automatically.
 Rules:
  1)constructor do not return types not even void.
  2)constructor should have same name as class name.
  3)constructor can have access modifiers like private public and protected.
  4)constructor can not have non access modifiers like static final synchronized.
  5)Default constructor is provided by java if we do not write one.
  6)when we the object of a class then a constructor is called for example if the class
  name is Dog Doge dog1=new Dog ();
  7)we can create multiple constructor to give the other users flexibility that they
  do not have to provide all the values to all the instance fields when creating an object of our the class.
  8)we call the constructor of the class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
  this() we can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructors to call
 "this" keyword:
  whenever we have same name variables as instance variable and local variables this keyword can helps us resolve
  the conflict between local and instance variables.

What is inheritance:
   It is a mechanism in Java through which we can get the properties and methods from the parent class
   inside the child class
Why we should use it:
   It helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write for example if there are some properties
   and methods which are parent in many classes we can create a perant class for all of them
   properties and can put the common properties or methods inside that parent class and can make childern
   extendes from that parent class.
How we can use it:
   1) create aparent class.
   2)put all the common methods and proptiers from childern class inside that class
