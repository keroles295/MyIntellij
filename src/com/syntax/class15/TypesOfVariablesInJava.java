public class TypesOfVariablesInJava {
    //there are 3
    //local: if a variable is inside a methods or loop or switch statement or if condition or parameters
    //it calls local variables
    //instance variable: if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of codes like method loop, switch
    //or if statement condition it called an instance variable
    //static: if a instance varaible has keyword with it then it is called static variables
    //why learn about different types of variable:
    //1) it helpes to take less momery
    //2)with the help to share information between methods
    //3)the local variables  occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as a your methods is done
    //excuting they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector
    // how to use them:
    //1)local: create inside block of code
    //Adavantage VS Disadvantage
    //local variables:
    //Advantage: they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time always try to use local variable when possible
    //Disadvantage:They are very limeted in scope means we can not access them outside of methods or that block of code
