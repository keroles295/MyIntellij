what is method overriding in java:
   when same method with same header exists in the child class as we called method overriding.
why we should to use it:
   if we inherit it from a class all the methods which are not private they are inherited in the child class now if
   we do not like some of these methods may because the consume more internet bandwidth or consume a lot of CPU or
   use a lot of memory we can override them the child class.
how we can use it:
   1)we must first inherit from a class.
   2)we can redeclare the method with same header and provide the body of our choice.
   class parent{
   void eat(){
   System.out.println("I like to eat beef");
   }
   void sleep(){
      System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
   }
   }
   calss chils extends{
    void eat(){
      System.out.println("I like to eat Mutton");
      }
      }
Rules:
    1)we must have a super class derived class realationship.
    2)Method in the parent class and child must have same header but they can be different in terms of access modifiers
    and in very rear condition in terms of return type.
    3) we can not change the access modifiers from public to protected or default, but we can do it in reverse order.
    4)we can not override constructor because also they are not inherited.
    5)if the method is static we use a different terminology it's called method redeclaration instead of overriding.
