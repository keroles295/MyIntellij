what Method Overloading in Java.
    with the help of method overloading we can have many methods with same name but
    different parameters in a class.
Why we should use MethodOverloading.
    1) Cleaner code if multiple methods are doing the same thing we don't need to come
    up with different names.
    2) Flexibility for the end user.
How we can use MethodOverloading in java.
    we can overload a method by changing three things
    1) Number of parameters
    2) change the data type of parameters
    3) we can change the sequence of parameters.
class Calculator{

int sum(int num1,int num2){
return num1+num2;
}

int sum(int num1,int num2,int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}

double sum(double num1,int num2,int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}

}

Rules:
    1) Method names should be same but parameters should be different.
    2) we can't overload a method by just changing its return type.
    3) We can also overload constructors by following the same rules.
