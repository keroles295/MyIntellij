What is a method
    Method in java is block of code *group of java statements). it defines the behaviour of a class

Why we should use methods:
    1) it helps remove the duplicate code from our application. We just create a method and
    every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
    2) it also allow to write the code in the form of modules which make the development
    of large applications easier.

    How to use MethodsL
    1) First we create the method inside a class.
    2)We create the object of that class
    3) we call the method by writing the name of the object a dot name of the method

class Calculator{

void add (int x, int y)
System.out.println(x+y);

}

public static void main (String [] args) {
Calculator  calculator = new Calculator();
calculator.add(10, 20);

}

Rules to create and use methods:
void add (int x, int y)
System.out.println(x+y);

}

void ==> void is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data write
    the same of that data type like for int we write int for String
    we write String and if we don't want to return anything we write void
    when we write a void we can't assign a method call toa variable.

add=> next we write the name of the method which can be anything it
    should follow the rules for giving a name to a variable
()=> We specify the data parameters here we can pass any data type inside these
    paranethesis
    they are optional we can leave them empty

    {
    System.out.println(x+y);
    }

add (int x, int y )=> This part with the name of the method and its parameters is called signature of a method

void add (int x, int y )header of the method
=================================================================

Types of Variables in Java:
    There are 3 types of variable 1) local 2) instance 3) static

    1) Local variable :

    if a variable is inside a method || a part of its parameters || or a loop || switch statement ||
    if else condition, it is called a local variable.

    2) Instance variable:

       If a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
       switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.

    3)static variable:

    If an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called a static variable

Why learn about different types of variable:
    1)  it helps us reduce the amount of RAM
        that our application will be using
        when it will be running.

    2)  We can pass information between methods of class with the help of these variables.

    3)  They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time of time as soon as your method is done
        executing they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector


How to use these:
    Local: Create inside block of code

Advantages vs Disadvantages

                        Local variables
advantages:     They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time
                Always try to use local variables when possible to save memory

disadvantages:  They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or the block
                of scope.

                        Instance variables:
Advantages:     They have broader scope as compared to local variables means we can access
                in all the methods of the class.

Disadvantages:  They occupy the space in your RAm for longer periods of time.

                        Static variables:
Advantages:    1)  We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
               2)  We can share a single value between all the objects of a class.


Disadvantages:
                          Static variables:
                1)They occupy the memory for longest period of time
                2)They can only hold a single value for all the objects
